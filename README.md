### Hi there 👋



My name is Mugiwara. i have been working as Community Moderator on several project and blockchains, such as solana, ethereum and IBC. I'm also a node runner. over the time i have a lot of connection and great experience.  I am always looking to take on new challenges and apply my skills to make a positive impact in the Community. I am excited to join a team and contribute my skills to achieve the project's goals and aspirations.

What can i do?
- 1). Assist in collaboration and partnership efforts by identifying potential partners, and helping to establish and maintain relationships with them.
- 2). Serve as a liaison between the community and the project by promptly responding to inquiries and addressing concerns on Discord and Telegram channels.
- 3). Effectively manage and resolve community issues by providing timely and accurate responses to tickets, escalating issues as appropriate, and keeping the community informed on the status of the problem.

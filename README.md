### Hi there üëã



My name is Gibran Radit. I live in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. I have been in crypto space since 2017, ethereum was the first coin I bought and have been in the space ever since. I have been working as Community Moderator on several project and blockchains, such as solana, ethereum, sui and Cosmos. Besides being a Community moderator, I'm also a node runner, validator and Testnet bounty hunter. Over the time i have a lot of connection and great experience.  I am always looking to take on new challenges and apply my skills to make a positive impact in the Community. I am excited to join a team and contribute my skills to achieve the project's goals and aspirations.

What can i do?
- 1). Assist in collaboration and partnership efforts by identifying potential partners, and helping to establish and maintain relationships with them.
- 2). Serve as a liaison between the community and the project by promptly responding to inquiries and addressing concerns on Discord and Telegram channels.
- 3). Effectively manage and resolve community issues by providing timely and accurate responses to tickets, escalating issues as appropriate, and keeping the community informed on the status of the problem.
- 4). Running Node and Validator to testing the project code, server and give the valuable feedback.
